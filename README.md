# Surfs Up

## Overview
Avy wants to open a surf and ice cream shop on Oahu. However, he's hesitate to do so before knowing more information about temperature trends to make sure that the business would be sustainable year-round. Therefore, an analysis of Oahu temperature data was preformed for the months of June and Decemeber.

- June and December have similar average (mean) temperatures with less than a 5 degree average difference between the two months. 
- There is slightly more variation in temperature in December than in June as shown by the higher standard deviation.  
- Both the minimum and maximum temperatures were not too far from average meaning that Hawaii does not have that big of temperature changes between the summer and winter. 


## Summary 

Avy's ice cream and surf shop business will need good weather year-round in order to thrive and this analysis shows that temperatures on Oahu are consistent from summer to winter with average temperatures only slightly cooler in December.


Another factor in whether or not a surf shop business will be successful other than temperature is precipitation, therefore it would be helpful to run an analysis on average monthly rainfall to see if there are seasonal differences that may impact the success of the business. 


Additionally, it might be interesting to see how long rainy weather lasts in a given time period to try to see if there would be more consecutive days of rain during a certain season.
